## Description
This program is designed to perform statistical analysis on a set of student scores. It prompts the user to input the number of students and their respective scores. After collecting the data, the program performs the following calculations:
- Sorting: It sorts the scores in ascending order.
- Average (Mean): It calculates the average (mean) score for the students.
- Median: It calculates the median score, which is the middle value in the sorted list. If there's an even number of scores, it takes the average of the two middle values.
- Standard Deviation: It computes the standard deviation, a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the scores.
- Minimum and Maximum: It finds the minimum and maximum scores in the dataset.
- Range: It calculates the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum scores.
- Scores Above Average: It creates a list of scores that are above the calculated average.  

After performing these calculations, the program displays the sorted scores, the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, range, and the list of scores above the average to provide a comprehensive overview of the student performance.
